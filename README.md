# About ExoPlex
A self-consistent mineral physics solver for exoplanets. We model rocky exoplanets with a core, lower and upper mantle, and water/ice layer. We use the Gibbs free energy minimization package, Perple_x (Connolly 09) along with a solution method from Stixrude 2011 to model mantles with natural phase transformations at depth (Pressure and Temperature dependence).

## Getting Started

ExoPlex is written in Python 3.7 and is currently stable to its full capability in the Mac OS and Linux platforms. The mineral physics solver for mantle phase transformations relies on a Fortran program, perple_x which is freely available from their website. We have included some precompiled phase solutions from perple_X so exoplex can be run without installing perple_x however, the user is limited in choice of planet composition to what is already included. Below we detail the full dependencies for exoplex.

### Requirements 

- Mac OS or Linux/Unix

- Perplex_x version 6.8.1 

- Python 3.7+

- Python libraries (use latest versions):
  - numpy: handle arrays 
  - os: search directories for files
  - math: math package 
  - matplotlib: plotting results from ExoPlex
  - pexpect: used to call Perple_X from python
  - multiprocessing: not absolutely necessary but if you can get this working, it cuts code runtime in half 
  - scipy: interpolation and integration
  - burnman: solves equations of state BME II,III, IV for the core and ice layers

 
#### Installing on Linux

1. Clone the master branch of this repo



2. Setup your workspace so that the scripts you write which call exoplex sit next to a directory called ```Solutions/``` which itself has another directory called ```Grids/```. For your workspace called ```workspace/``` your directory tree should look like:


```
myworkspace/
│   example.py    
└───Solutions/ 
│   │
│   └───Grids/
|   |   |   
```

3. From the ExoPlex GitHub page, download the .tar files located in Solutions/. Put this in your local ```Solutions/``` directory and unpack. This will provide many precompiled mineral physics solutions for ExoPlex to use.     


4. The first time you run ExoPlex, it will download the necessary programs from the perple_X website. These are located at http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/ExoPlex/


## Using ExoPlex

ExoPlex is meant to be run as a library complimentary to your python scripts. 
We are currently working on a version which is meant to be added to PyPI and used as an external library.
Rrigh now, we reccomend cloning this repository and writing your scripts in a workspace near your local copy of exoplexparty library from PyPI. Despite this, ExoPlex is not entirely a standalone program. Users are required to setup their workspace so ExoPlex may read and store local files. 
The following sections describe these dependencies.

### Workspace directory tree

Your workspace should look like the following: 

```
myworkspace/
|   example.py
|   params.py
|   input_1.py
└───Solutions/ 
│   │
│   └───Grids/
|   |   |   
```

Assuming you are working in an arbitrary directory called ```myworkspace/```. You should have at least the ```params.py``` and ```input_1.py``` files at the root. These and several example scripts can be found on the GitHub page under the ```examples``` folder.  

Your scripts should be stored alongside ```Soulutions/```. The ```Soulutions/``` directory stores the outputs from perple_X which give mineralogy and thermodynamic parameters depending on composition. Each .dat file represents a different composition. We leave this at the top level so users can directly access these files to diagnose errors that may arise. In some cases, you will need to change the parameters for perple_X (located in ```params.py```. Within solutions, you will need to initialize a ```Grids/``` directory. Grid outputs will be stored here by default. 

It is important to remember that ExoPlex is designed to work only in this environment. That is, the user should have a directory tree that exactly match the one above. For example, naming your solution folder ```solutions/``` instead of ```Solutions/``` will cause ExoPlex to break. 

### params.py

This file will hold parameters which determine how ExoPlex makes models. Each parameter is described within this file. ```params.py``` also includes the parameters for running perple_x. Be cautious when altering these parameters. 

The only parameter users may need to change is the temperature and pressure ranges for the lower and upper mantle. These control the domain perple_x will use to find mineral assemblages. For creating very massive planets above 4 Earth masses (not recommended), for example, the user will need to have perple_x rerun the solution file for the desired composition with a wider range of pressure and temperature. This is because the conditions reached in the mantles of more massive planets can exceed the default temperature and pressure ranges, causing ExoPlex to break.


### calling functions

Once the above dependencies have been resolved and you are in the working directory with the proper directory tree, you may start using ExoPlex! In your script, import exoplex:


```python
import exoplex.run as run
```

This will set you up to run the functions detailed in the following section.
